# Programming without statements

This is an exercise in programming in JavaScript without statements.

## Puzzles

1. FizzBuzz
2. Towers of Hanoi

## Rules

1. No statements allowed apart from what's in the template.
2. No creating global variables, either implicitly or through the global object.
3. No comma operator unless absolutely necessary.
4. The containing function cannot be used for recursion.

## Template

Replace `undefined` with the expression.
`f` can be replaced with a descriptive name.

```javascript
function f() {
  return undefined;
}

module.exports = {
  f,
};
```
